               Hello there! 
               Thank you for taking the time to vist my portfolio. I would like to start off by introducing myself. 
               <br><br>
               My name is Diana Portillo. I was born in San Francisco CA I lived there for about 5 years then my parents moved us to Richmond CA. I have 2 siblings an older sister
               and a younger brother. Yes, I know I am the lucky black sheep!
               I am a very very happy dog mom to my German Shepherd her name is Zola. She was a COVID doggo! I got her when she was just a puppy she is now
               2 years old. 
                <br><br>
                I am currently a full time student at San Francisco State. Throughout my community college years I probably changed my major more than 4 times. I dropped out once,
                I was on academic probabtion, and nearly gave up on school all together. It was very hard for me to find something I had passion and drive for. I was initally a nursing major then switched to Kinesiology
                and now I found myself switching my major to Computer Science. After so many years of struggles, doubts, and hopeless I can finally say I found
                motivation for a line of work and that is CODING! Although, coding has not been the easiest from all my struggles it definitely
                has been worth it and has taught me so much! This is just the beginning to a lifetime career and I am very excited to bring you all along on this journery with me!
