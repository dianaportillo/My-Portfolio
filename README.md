# My-Portfolio
## Creating My Portfolio for my future employer.

--- Overview 
Given the opportunity to interview for an employer. 
I will create My Portfolio to demonstrate my skills and expertise. This will help myself and
my future employer decide what role fits best with my skills. This will also help direct me into
specific jobs and alter muy strengths and weaknesses.

### The Challenge:
A company has given me a mock-up portfolio to help direct me into building my own. 
From the different material I have learned I will apply my knowledge to build my portfolio 
and apply the different styles to my liking. As well as inserting my own projects that I 
have designed myself in my course so far.

### User Story:
"AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position"

### Acceptance Criteria:
"GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport"

## My Process:
After learning advanced CSS and HTML I will use my skills to create my own portfolio. 
I have been given a mock-up to help direct and instruct into doing my own. 

### Built With:
HTML and Advanced CSS

### What I Learned:
This week I learned different techniques to help build a website from scratch. From using the inspect
tool to reviewing the material I learned throughout the week. Following the steps and rewatching the lectures
gave me a better understanding which elements to use when creating my own codes.
